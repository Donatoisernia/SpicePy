# SpicePy
**SpicePy** is a name coming from the merge of **SPICE** (*Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis*) and **Python**, hence, it goes without saying that it is a _Circuit simulator written in python_

**SpicePy** borns as a teaching project. It is shared with students of *basic circuit theory* with two aims:

* to allow them to check the results of exercises solved analytically
* to show them how a numerical code to solve circuit is made
